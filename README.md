# Phaser-JS-Game
Currently a work in progress
Note that if the screen remains black, it is because the text occasionaly doesnt show up, so just click to transition to the game scene
Controls: 
Arrow keys to move
hold shift when against a platform to wall cling and you can wall jump
hazards are snomwen and spikes
green sphere gives you a jump boost when you jump
Some sprites were from codecademy, others from me.
